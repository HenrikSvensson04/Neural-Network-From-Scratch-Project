### How to use 
- run with command: 'cargo run' in your terminal
- Open your brower and open localhost:8080/visualize (should at least work on chrome)

### What the project includes
- Neural network implementation from scratch
- Simple visualization with the d3 library


## Objectives of project
- Learn the fundamentals of neural networks and the backpropagation algorithm
- Apply my skills in multivariable calculus and linear algebra
- Learn the basics of javascript and webprograming in general


## Languages and libraries used
- Rust
- WebAssembly for Rust
- JavaScript
- Html/CSS
- D3 library
- Actix web (for a simple local webserver)
