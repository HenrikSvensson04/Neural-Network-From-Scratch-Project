# Neural-Network-From-Scratch-Project



## This is only the demo version, for complete version I shall:
- Make it possible to change number of hidden layers in the visualization. The underlying code in rust already supports this.
- Clean the code and add comments
- Add more datasets
- Improve visualization colors
- Implement stochatic gradient decent
- Make it possible to change learning rate in the visualization. The underlying code in rust already supports this.
- Add different activation functions
- And more ..

## How it loooks

## How to use 
- run with command: 'cargo run' in your terminal
- Open your brower and open localhost:8080/visualize (should at least work on chrome)

## What the project includes
- Neural network implementation from scratch
- Simple visualization with the d3 library


### Objectives of project
- Learn the fundamentals of neural networks and the backpropagation algorithm
- Apply my skills in multivariable calculus and linear algebra
- Learn the basics of javascript and webprograming in general


### Languages and libraries used
- Rust
- WebAssembly for Rust
- JavaScript
- Html/CSS
- D3 library
- Actix web (for a simple local webserver)
